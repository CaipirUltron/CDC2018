\label{sec:intro}

% robotics framework
% ISP structure and advantages of direct stabilization
% highlight difference btw stabilization and tracking; cite Sliding Mode works when only stabilization is applied
% multivariable STC
% advantages when compared to model-based schemes (robustness)
% necessity of using HOSMO for achieving less chattering in output feedback schemes
% contribuitions: (i) use of STC cascade strategy to schieve both stabilization AND tracking;
% (ii) HOSMO for output feedback stabilization

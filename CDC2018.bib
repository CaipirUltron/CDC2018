The main control objective concerns in isolating devices such as cameras, array of sensors, or weapons, from motion caused to their host platform or vehicle. This problem is usually solved combining a set of measures obtained by gyroscopic sensors and accelerometers, which provide complete and even redundant information of motion needed to compensation. In this paper, this problem is discussed in the context where only two gyro measures are available. Different sensor configuration are considered, as well as appearing restrictions to motion control due to this reduced number of sensors.},

annote = {First it is considered the 1 DOF case, putting the inertial device in the base, and then on the camera. The transfer function is calculated on both cases and it concludes that the transfer functions are similar. In the first case, the control should track the wave frequencies, while in the other case, it should reject them, which are seen as disturbances.
Then shows the 2 DOF case (Pan/Tilt), but it just calculates the rotation between the inertial base and the camera. It is assumed that the 2 joints are decoupled.
The DC motor transfer function (with reduction) is studied (for the 1 DOF case). In the end, some simplifications are done due to the fast time response of the motor and it becomes an integrator.
A PI integer is proposed for the 1 DOF case. The transfer function to the reference is transformed to a second order transfer function with $\xi$ and $\omega$n. The gains are chosen so that frequencies up to 5Hz have near 0dB of attenuation, while higher frequencies are filtered (dual case for the INS on the camera).
The implementation (Chapter 4) is not important, besides "Par{\^{a}}metros de configura{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do sensor inercial" (could be useful, and the fact that it was implemented with Pan/Tilt. The motors operate at 1KHz.
The results showed that the algorithm was not working well with the gain, so it was cut in half (trying to eliminate noise with higher frequencies). So it ended up working.
The camera was used to detect the red point, but that is not important for us.
Conclusion/Future: Drift on IMU was slow so it could be fixed by an operator. No filters implemented for the IMU. Discretization not done.
Question: He showed the control for the 1 DOF case, but he implemented the 2 DOF case, and he controlled it  with 2 uncoupled systems (Pan controlled separated from Tilt).},

Many of these effects can influence the initial configuration of the system as well as design details later in the design process. The successful design of an ISP usually requires a multidisciplinary design team. The design of an ISP must often be closely coordinated with that of other major subsystems such as the primary sensor and the optics. The role of the systems engineer in the design process is perhaps the most critical because other members of the team may not be aware of the consequences of many of the effects discussed above. Inertially stabilized platforms (ISPs) are used to stabilize and point a broad array of sensors, cameras, telescopes, and weapon systems.},

A special attention is given to the closed-loop bandwidth.
The most common model and control loop is to have a high-bandwidht vel. loop for disturbance rejection and LOS control inside a lower bandwidth pos. loop for tracking. Commonly, PI controls are used, but disturbance rejection can be improved with more sophisticated techniques (state variable feedback, adaptive control, robust, fuzzy, disturbance observers, LQR, LQG, sliding mode, Hinf, ...).
When the IMU is mounted on the base, they call the control scheme as a "feedforward technique".

The aspects of the system performance and robustness are analyzed and compared with single speed loop control structure in detail. The inner speed loop adopts PI tuner to overcome the influence of nonlinearities caused by friction and mechanical resonances and a time optimal self-tuning PID control algorithm is developed to bate the carrier disturbance in outer stabilized loop.

Mounting the angular rate and acceleration sensors directly on the LOS axes is often used for precision pointing applications. This configuration impacts gimbal size, and the sensors must be capable of withstanding high angular slew rates. With the other stabilization method, sensors are mounted on the gimbal base, which alleviates some issues with the direct approach but may be less efficient, since disturbances are not measured in the LOS coordinate frame. This paper investigates the impact of LOS disturbances and sensor noise on the performance of each stabilization control loop configuration. It provides a detailed analysis of the mechanisms by which disturbances are coupled to the LOS track vector for each approach, and describes the advantages and disadvantages of each. It concludes with a performance comparison based upon simulated sensor noise and three sets of platform disturbance inputs ranging from mild to harsh disturbance environments.},

abstract = {This paper presents an uncertain linear model for an Inertial Stabilization Platform (ISP). The system has a 2 degree of freedom (DOF) gimbal which will be attached to a moving vehicle and the optical sensors mounted on stabilized gimbal. The main purpose of an ISP is to eliminate the various disturbance and body motion to make the line of sight (LOS), hold steady in an inertial space. Due to dynamical model of the 2-DOF gimbal, friction, cable restraint, noise, other disturbances from the outside environment and the motions of the vehicle's body (as a result of maneuvering or vibration), the pointing and tracking accuracy of the gimbaled system may strongly degrade. These disturbances are typically nonlinear. Modeling and controlling the stabilization loop with these nonlinearities are the main problem. The approach of this paper is considering a linear doubted model. Linearity makes the model simple and so linear classic controller can be used to meeting design requirements. Therefore the cost of the design and implementation stages will decrease. In addition uncertainty makes the model practical and so the nonlinear nature of mentioned disturbance can be interpreted by this model. So this built ISP by a PI controller which is capable enough to overcome the disturbances and to meet the implication requirements will be controlled. For decreasing the effect of these uncertainties and other probable variation in ISP's parameters on system performance, a determined simple structure for robust enhancer compensator is used and designed.},

The design descriptions herein are mostly generic, with occasional references to existing or past strategic systems. The article discusses four primary topics, namely, system design options, environments and mitigation techniques, preflight calibration and alignment (C{\&}A) in-flight navigation mechanizations, and test and verification. IEEE standard terminology of inertial sensors and inertial systems is used throughout the article. The best-known application of ISPs is stabilization and control of payloads such as electro-optical sensors and laser beams. Perhaps less well known is that ISPs are used in a variety of aircraft and missile navigation systems. With the introduction of digital computers, the breadth of application of ISPs for navigation began to diminish, and strapdown INS became prevalent. This trend has accelerated with the navigation aiding of the global positioning system (GPS), which can render a strapdown inertial measurement unit (IMU) more accurate than the best ISPs. Today, only self-contained precision navigation systems use ISPs. Strategic navigation systems are among this small group.},

The presented models are simulated for a Mitsubishi PA10-6CE robotic manipulator characteristics mounted on a ship platform that is moving on ocean and the results are verified through both methods. In this simulation it is assumed that the inertia of the base of the robot is large enough and is not affected by the manipulator motion. However, the motion of the ship directly influences the dynamics of the manipulator in movements. Results and computation time of the two methods are compared and it is shown that the Newton-Euler method needs less computation time than the Lagrange method.",

The inefficiency of the classic Lagrangian formulation is well known, leading several researchers to a new formulation based on the Newton-Euler equations. This formulation is highly ef ficient, but there may be some confusion as to the source of this efficiency. This paper shows that there is in fact no fundamental difference in computational efficiency between Lagrangian and Newton-Euler formulations. The efficiency of the above-mentioned Newton-Euler formula tion is due to two factors: the recursive structure of the computation and the representation chosen for the rota tional dynamics. Both of these factors can be achieved in a Lagrangian formulation. Recursive Lagrangian dy namics has been discussed previously by Hollerbach. This paper compares the representations that have been used and shows that with a proper choice the Lagrangian formulation is indeed equivalent to the Newton-Euler formulation.}

abstract = {This thesis addresses a few technical problems that are all related to the central topic of inertial stabilization of the optical axis of an airborne camera system (so-called line-of-sight stabilization). First, the task of augmentation of the classical inertial stabilization loop with an automatic visual tracking loop is solved in a systematic way invoking the concepts from the young discipline of visual servoing. Second, the issue of computer-vision-induced delays was tackled and an intuitive engineering solution was formulated as a special instance of a reset control, a modified Smith predictor and a multirate control, which allowed to propose more efficient solutions. Third, the advanced mechanical configuration with two motors ac- tuating the rotation of the optical payload around a common axis (so-called dual-stage con- figuration) was studied and recent numerical optimization tools for structured H∞-optimal controller design were used to provide controllers with a performance superior to the one obtained with classically tuned PID loops. Definition and selection of these research topics were motivated by a collaboration with an industrial partner within a series of projects. Therefore the thesis also documents a few routine engineering results for completeness. Namely, mathematical modeling of the kinematics and dynamics of common mechanical configurations such as double-gimbal and dual-stage configurations, inertial estimation, de- sign of a feedforward disturbance rejection controller and input command shaping filters. All the algorithms were always implemented in one of the available benchmark systems and tested either in a laboratory or even during helicopter flights},

@article{Walrath1984,
abstract = {Gimbal bearing friction is a major source of stabilization errors for airborne pointing and tracking systems. This paper describes a novel addition to conventional stabilization techniques which has recently been incorporated in such a system to greatly improve stabilization performance. This addition contains a model in system software which predicts realtime friction torque values. This new, dynamic friction model, which is the result of recent investigations into dynamic friction characteristics, is adaptively adjusted into agreement with actual friction behavior by processing inputs from conventional system sensors. Measurements from these sensors cause on-line adjustment of model parameters, resulting in 'adaptive' compensator action. The model's output is used to generate an addition to conventional stabilization subsystem commands. The resulting additional gimbal motor torque is equal and opposed to the actual friction disturbance such that the residual torque, and hence stabilization errors, are a small fraction of those for an uncompensated system. The model-referenced compensator thus operates in a predictive, adaptive, feedforward manner to pre-condition the stabilization subsystem, reducing stabilization errors well below levels which are achievable through conventional feedback operation alone. ?? 1984.},

@article{Debruin2008,
abstract = {Mobile VSAT satcom antenna systems are available on the market today but are just in their infancy. All observers of the satellite industry see great growth potential for this market. Press releases announcing a new product offering are now common, and an Internet search for "satcom on-the-move" produces tens of thousands of hits. Already one can find examples of delayed or failed products that suffered from poor control system performance. As discussed herein, a basic understanding of apertures and their performance is needed by the control system designer, to the same extent an appreciation of servo issues is needed by the antenna company product manager in possession of a suitable aperture. Clearly, a system engineering approach with careful tradeoffs of size, weight, power, radio-frequency, and control system issues should be undertaken before press releases are issued.},
